1. For weak MCU like AT51 series, use Common Anode 7 Segments Digitube

Dig1-2-3-4 :  use PNP transistor for each, to provide V+ (active high -- so common anode) for all segments abcdef,
each segments use active low to sink to turn on (low to on)
Reason:  only using PNP transistor can provide V+ for all segments.

If using Common cathode:
   Dig1-2-3-4 use direct sink or NPN,  and each segments abcdef must use active high (not likely possible for a weak MCU!)
   
   
2. For more powerful MCU like STM8, can use common Cathode :
Dig1-2-3-4: direct connect, use Active Low to enable, it's sink so provide V- sink for all segments should be fine.
Each segement abcdef use high to enable.

If use common anode :
Dig1-2-3-4: direct connect, use Active high to enable ( for common anode), but it may not be powerful enough to provide V+ power for all segments!

TM1637 IC:  use common anode
TM1638  IC: use common cathode, but also support common anode 
TM1639  IC: use common cathode, but also support common anode
